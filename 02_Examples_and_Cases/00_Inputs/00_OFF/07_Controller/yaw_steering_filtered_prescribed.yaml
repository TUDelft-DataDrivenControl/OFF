controller:
  name: Prescribed filtered motion yaw steering controller
  description: Applies prescribed yaw trajectories to the turbines, the trajectories are taken as setpoints, whcih are only applied if a given threshold is overcome

  settings:
    ctl: "prescribed filtered yaw controller"
    misalignment_thresh: 2 # in deg, applied as Â± threshold (e.g. 2 deg will result in 4 deg wide dead-band)
    average_window: 1 # in time steps, has to be an integer. Time step length is set in the simulation yaml
    orientation: True # Checks if the data is given as orientation or, if false, as yaw angles
    integration_error_correction: True # If true, the error of the turbine alignment will be integrated and if it is larger than a threshold, it will be corrected.
    integration_thresh: 10 # in deg*s, if the integrated error to the wind direction is larger than the given threshold the turbine will move to correct it, event if the instantaneous error is smaller than the dead-band
