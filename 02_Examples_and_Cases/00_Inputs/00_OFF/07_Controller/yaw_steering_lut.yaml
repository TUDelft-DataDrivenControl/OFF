controller:
  name: Look-up-table based yaw steering controller
  description: Chooses yaw angles based on the current main wind direction and a lut for it. Only corrects if offset to the averaged wind direction is larger then a given offset

  settings:
    ctl: "LUT yaw controller"
    misalignment_thresh: 2 # in deg
    average_window: 1 # in time steps, has to be an integer. Time step length is set in the simulation yaml
    orientation: False # Checks if the data is given as orientation or, if false, as yaw angles
