controller:
  name: Realistic greedy baseline
  description: Follows the main wind direction, only corrects if offset to the averaged wind direction is larger then a given offset

  settings:
    ctl: "RealGreedyBaseline"
    misalignment_thresh: 2 # in deg
    average_window: 1 # in time steps, has to be an integer. Time step length is set in the simulation yaml
    apply_frequency: 6 # in time steps, has to be an integer. Time step length is set in the simulation yaml
    update_to_current: True # if false, the controller updates to the wind direction orientation that occurred at the time of crossing the threshold
